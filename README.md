# Voting App Backend

A backend API for a voting/polling application built with Java and Spring Boot.

This project is currently in progress and serves as a practice project for backend development and API design using Java.

The goal is to allow users to create polls, vote, and view poll results — with basic authentication and RESTful endpoints.

## ✅ Planned Initial Features

- Authenticated users can create new polls with multiple options and a deadline.
- Authenticated users can vote in available polls.
- The system prevents users from voting more than once in the same poll.
- Voting is not allowed after deadline.
